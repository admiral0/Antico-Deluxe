Antico Deluxe is a Qt4/X11 Window/Desktop manager for GNU/Linux.
It is a fork of famous Antico WM/DE by Giuseppe Cigala, http://antico.wordpress.com/

The goal is to create a Window/Desktop manager simple and fast, with very aesthetic
and familiar look and feel. 
A very few parameters must be configured from few files, avoiding unnecessary complications, 
following the K.I.S.S. philosophy. Any other configurations like themes, icons etc. should be avoided.
If you don't like the heaviness of KDE/Gnome, contribute at development...
